To Do list, Otagle 2:

1. Gestures.
Change of the layer just by using touch functionality and gesture.

*2. Pictures acting as buttons.
Integration of code snippet found on AHK forum.

*3. AHK 2.0.
Maybe it solves a problem of dynamic #include directive. To be checked. Then it would be possible to use .ahk scripts instead of .exe functions.
No, it doesn't. Checked on 2020-04-12

4. Scallable picture graphics (.svg preferably).
it was done as File Explorer plugin, so it should be possible for Otagle as well.

5. Build library of functions.
For Microsoft Word, Total Commander.

*6. Make GUIs in separate functions.
Clean up the code.

7. Speed up saving of options.

8. Add menu.
*8.1. Configuration.
*8.2. Logo.
*8.3. About.
